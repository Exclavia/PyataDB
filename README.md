# PynexDB: A lightweight, efficient, and easy to use database

PynexDB is a **lightweight**, **efficient**, and **easy-to-use** database built entirely in Python. It's designed for small to medium-sized projects where a full-fledged database system like PostgreSQL or MySQL might be overkill. PynexDB allows you to store and retrieve data easily with only a few lines of code. (See [Usage](#usage))

Best use case would be embedded in projects for an extended data storage. It has not been tested in heavily accessed environments with frequently changing data. Nor has it been tested in a production environment. Just a little project/tool originally made for personal usage.
